# Library Management System
- Create a class Book that has a constructor that takes in a title, author and isbn number. Inside the constructor we need to set the 3 attributes title, author, isbn and add another boolean attribute is_borrowed set initially to False.
- Next create 4 book instances
- Override the __str__ method and print out the attribute properly
- Create a class library that has a constructor that initializes a lift of books to an empty list
- define a method add_book
