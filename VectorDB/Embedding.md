# Vector Database and Embedding


# Basics of Embedding
By now we understand that Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI works on numbers. And when we talk of Natural Langiage or Text then these things as well need to be converted into numbers and at a high level this process is called Embedding.

Example:
Say for word "Apple" has the numerical representation as [0.1, 0.3, 0.05]. Its just an example to demonstrate that embedding is to present a text into numeric format and this process is done using some methods internally, and the result or representation is in numbers in kind of vector form so these are called as Vector Embedding.
