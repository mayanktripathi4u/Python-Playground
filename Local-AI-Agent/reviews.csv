Title,Date,Rating,Review
Best pizza in town,2024-03-15,5,"The crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Their signature pepperoni pizza had the perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, and the pepperoni curled up into little cups of deliciousness. Will definitely be back!"
Disappointed with service,2024-02-20,2,"While the pizza itself was decent, we waited over an hour for delivery despite being told it would be 30 minutes. When it finally arrived, it was barely warm. The flavors were good but the experience ruined it."
Authentic Italian experience,2024-01-05,5,"This place reminds me of the pizzerias in Naples. Their wood-fired Margherita pizza has that perfect char, fresh basil, and buffalo mozzarella that melts in your mouth. The owner even came out to chat with us about Italy."
Overpriced for what you get,2024-03-01,3,"$24 for a medium pizza with just two toppings seems excessive. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was good, but nothing justified the premium price. There are better values elsewhere in town."
Great gluten-free option,2024-02-15,4,"As someone with celiac disease, finding good gluten-free pizza is a challenge. Their cauliflower crust was one of the best I've had - doesn't fall apart and has a nice flavor. Toppings were generous too."
Family night favorite,2024-03-10,5,"We bring our kids here every Friday night. The staff always make them feel special, providing dough for them to play with while we wait. Their kid-sized pizzas are perfect, and the parents love the craft beer selection."
Greasy and disappointing,2024-01-25,2,"I had high hopes based on the reviews, but my pizza was swimming in grease. The crust was undercooked in the center, and the promised 'fresh vegetables' looked and tasted canned. Such a letdown."
Hidden gem for vegans,2024-02-28,5,"I can't believe how good their vegan pizza is! They make their own cashew cheese that actually melts properly, and their vegetable toppings are always fresh and seasonal. Even my non-vegan friends love it."
Mediocre at best,2024-03-05,3,"Nothing terrible but nothing special either. The crust was okay, toppings were standard, and service was fine. It's the kind of place you go when you're in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip for."
Late night savior,2024-01-15,4,"Open until 2am on weekends, this place has saved me many times after a night out. Their slices are huge, reheated perfectly crisp, and they have creative toppings that hit the spot when you're hungry late at night."
Spicy special was too much,2024-02-10,2,"Their 'Firebreather' pizza should come with a warning label. It wasn't enjoyably spicy - it was painfully hot to the point where I couldn't taste anything else. Had to throw most of it away."
Perfect thin crust,2024-03-18,5,"If you're a thin crust fan, this is your place. Cracker-thin, crispy all the way through, yet somehow still has a nice chew. Their simple cheese pizza showcases their excellent sauce - slightly sweet with a nice herb blend."
Dirty restaurant,2024-01-20,1,"I was shocked at the state of this place. Tables were sticky, floors were dirty, and I could see into the kitchen which didn't look any better. Couldn't enjoy my pizza as I was too concerned about hygiene standards."
Best Hawaiian in the city,2024-02-25,5,"I know Hawaiian pizza is controversial, but if you're a fan, you must try theirs. They use fresh pineapple (not canned) and house-cured ham that's sliced thick. The sweet and salty balance is perfect."
Too much sauce,2024-03-08,3,"The ingredients seemed high quality, but they absolutely drown their pizzas in sauce. My crust was soggy in minutes, and all I could taste was tomato. Asked for light sauce on a second pizza and it was much better."
Amazing Detroit-style,2024-01-10,5,"Their Detroit-style square pizza is incredible - crispy cheese edges, fluffy interior, and those corner pieces are to die for! The pepperoni cup and char perfectly. Worth the 30-minute wait."
Inconsistent quality,2024-02-08,3,"I've been here three times. First visit: amazing. Second: terrible. Third: just okay. Seems like it really depends on who's working that day. Wish they could maintain better quality control."
Perfect for lunch specials,2024-03-12,4,"Their lunch deal is unbeatable - $10 for a 10-inch pizza and small salad. The pizza comes out quickly, is always fresh, and the perfect size for one person. Great place for a work lunch."
Too noisy for conversation,2024-01-30,3,"The pizza was good - I especially liked their sausage and mushroom combination - but the restaurant is like an echo chamber. Couldn't hear my date across the table. Better as a takeout option."
Best white pizza ever,2024-02-18,5,"Their 'White Album' pizza with ricotta, mozzarella, garlic, and spinach is phenomenal. The cheeses are creamy but not heavy, and the fresh garlic adds the perfect punch. Don't skip the spicy honey drizzle!"
New owners ruined it,2024-03-03,2,"This used to be our favorite place, but it changed hands three months ago and it's not the same. The dough doesn't have the same flavor, the sauce is too sweet now, and they seem to use lower quality cheese."
Creative seasonal specials,2024-01-12,5,"Just had their spring special with asparagus, lemon ricotta, and prosciutto. The combination was bright, fresh, and perfect for the season. Love that they use local, seasonal ingredients."
Epic meat lovers option,2024-02-22,4,"If you're a carnivore, their 'Butcher's Block' pizza is incredible. Five different meats, all high quality - the soppressata and house-made sausage are standouts. Just be ready for a food coma afterward!"
Burnt crust ruins it,2024-03-07,2,"They claim 'char' is part of the Neapolitan experience, but there's a difference between char and burnt. The entire bottom of my pizza was black and bitter. Scraping it off meant losing half the crust."
Perfect for big groups,2024-01-23,5,"We had a party of 12 and they accommodated us perfectly. Their 20-inch shareable pizzas are great for groups, and they were happy to do half-and-half toppings to please everyone. Service was impressively coordinated."
Undercooked in the middle,2024-02-12,2,"The edges of the pizza were fine, but the middle was doughy and undercooked. The toppings were sliding off the soggy center. When I mentioned it, they just said that's how their pizza is supposed to be."
Phenomenal crust,2024-03-20,5,"Whatever they do to their dough is magical - it's got that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with a slight sourdough tang. I could eat their plain crust by itself, it's that good."
Skimpy on toppings,2024-01-18,3,"The quality of ingredients is good, but they're incredibly stingy with toppings. Counted just 10 pepperoni slices on a 14-inch pizza. For the price they charge, this feels like a rip-off."
Excellent beer pairing suggestions,2024-02-27,5,"Not only is their pizza excellent (try the fig and prosciutto!), but the staff is knowledgeable about their craft beer selection and can suggest the perfect pairing for whatever pizza you order."
Too salty,2024-03-02,2,"Everything I tried was oversalted - the crust, the sauce, and especially the cheese. It was like they were trying to ensure you'd order more drinks. Couldn't finish my pizza and was thirsty all night."
Perfect NY-style slices,2024-01-08,5,"As a transplant from NYC, I've been searching for authentic NY-style pizza. This place nails it - thin, foldable slices with the right amount of chew and grease. Their plain cheese slice is perfection."
Terrible delivery experience,2024-02-14,1,"Ordered for Valentine's Day and regretted it. Pizza took 2 hours to arrive, was cold, and had the wrong toppings. Called the restaurant and they seemed completely unconcerned. Never again."
Innovative toppings,2024-03-16,5,"Their 'Experimental' menu section is amazing. Just tried one with maple-glazed brussels sprouts, pancetta, and smoked gouda - sounds weird but it was incredible. They're not afraid to take risks."
Not enough cheese,2024-01-28,3,"The sauce and crust were good, but they're stingy with cheese. You could see the sauce through the sparse cheese layer, and what was there didn't have that stretchy pull you want from a good pizza."
Perfect crust-to-topping ratio,2024-02-05,5,"Some places overload toppings so the crust gets soggy, others are too sparse. This place gets it perfect - enough toppings to get some in every bite, but not so much that the structural integrity is compromised."
Rude staff ruined the meal,2024-03-11,2,"The pizza itself was decent, but the counter staff was incredibly rude - sighing when I asked questions about ingredients, rushing my order, and actually rolling their eyes when I requested extra napkins."
Excellent for takeout,2024-01-13,4,"Their pizza travels remarkably well. Even after a 20-minute drive home, the crust was still crispy and everything was at the perfect temperature. They have their packaging technique down to a science."
Too expensive for pizza,2024-02-19,3,"The pizza is good, I'll give them that. But $30 for a basic large cheese pizza is highway robbery. Add toppings and you're looking at $40-50. The quality doesn't justify these premium prices."
Fresh ingredients make the difference,2024-03-04,5,"You can taste the difference in their sauce - clearly made from fresh tomatoes, not canned. Same with their vegetable toppings - all crisp and fresh. Makes other pizza places seem processed in comparison."
Tiny portion sizes,2024-01-26,2,"Their 'personal' pizza is the size of a CD. For $15, I expected something that would actually satisfy my hunger. Had to order a second one, turning a quick lunch into an expensive disappointment."
Excellent Chicago deep dish,2024-02-23,5,"Hard to find authentic Chicago-style pizza in this area, but they nail it. The buttery, flaky crust, the layering of cheese under the sauce, the chunky tomato topping - all perfect. Worth the 45-minute cook time."
Too greasy to enjoy,2024-03-09,2,"Had to literally blot my pizza with napkins, which came away completely saturated with grease. Whatever flavor might have been there was drowned in oil. Couldn't finish it as it was making me feel ill."
Perfect balance of flavors,2024-01-16,5,"Their 'Mediterranean' pizza has the perfect balance of flavors - the briny olives, tangy feta, fresh tomatoes, and herb-infused olive oil all complement each other without any one element overwhelming the others."
Bland sauce needs work,2024-02-09,3,"The crust had a nice texture and the toppings were fine, but the sauce lacked any personality - no hint of herbs, garlic, or even salt. Since sauce is the foundation of a good pizza, this was disappointing."
Excellent customer service,2024-03-17,5,"Made a mistake on my online order and called the restaurant in a panic. They were so accommodating - halted production on the wrong pizza, made the correction, and even threw in free garlic knots for the trouble."
Doughy and undercooked,2024-01-21,2,"The crust was still doughy and pale. When I mentioned it, they said that's their style, but it just seemed undercooked. The toppings were sliding off because there was no structure to hold them."
Perfectly crispy crust,2024-02-24,5,"However they achieve it, their crust has the perfect crispness all the way through - no soggy middle! Even the slices with lots of toppings maintain their structural integrity. Engineering marvel of pizza."
Way too much oregano,2024-03-06,2,"Do they measure their oregano with a shovel? It was completely overpowering - couldn't taste anything else. My entire car smelled like an Italian herb garden on the drive home, and not in a good way."
Authentic coal-fired perfection,2024-01-03,5,"Their coal-fired oven gives the pizza a distinctive char and smoky flavor that's impossible to replicate any other way. The slight bitterness of the charred spots perfectly balances the sweetness of the sauce."
Refrigerated dough taste,2024-02-16,2,"The crust had that distinctive 'refrigerator' taste that comes from dough that's been sitting around too long. Fresh dough has a sweet, yeasty flavor - this had none of that. Clearly not made fresh daily as advertised."
Perfect for picky eaters,2024-03-13,4,"Their 'build your own quarter' option is genius - a large pizza divided into quadrants with different toppings. Perfect for our family where everyone wants something different. No more ordering multiple pizzas!"
Sauce like ketchup,2024-01-27,2,"The sauce was suspiciously sweet and one-dimensional, reminiscent of ketchup rather than a proper pizza sauce. No evidence of herbs, garlic, or any complexity. Ruined what otherwise could have been a decent pizza."
Perfect pepperoni placement,2024-02-17,5,"As a pepperoni perfectionist, I appreciate that they space the pepperoni so every bite gets one full piece. No bare spots or clumped areas. Shows attention to detail that elevates the whole experience."
Not worth the wait,2024-03-14,3,"90-minute wait on a Thursday night with no option to call ahead. The pizza was good when we finally got it, but nothing special enough to justify such a long wait. Many comparable options with better systems."
Crispy yet chewy perfection,2024-01-19,5,"How they achieve a crust that's simultaneously crispy on the outside and chewy inside is beyond me, but it's perfect. The contrast in textures makes every bite interesting, and it holds up well to the toppings."
Too much cornmeal,2024-02-13,3,"They use cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to prevent sticking, which is standard, but they use so much that it's like eating pizza on a sandpaper surface. Gritty texture overwhelms the experience."
Incredible vodka sauce base,2024-03-19,5,"Their vodka sauce pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil is something special. The creamy, slightly spicy sauce is a perfect alternative to traditional tomato sauce. Add prosciutto for an extra flavor dimension!"
Cold center burnt edges,2024-01-22,2,"The pizza looked beautiful but had serious temperature issues - edges were burnt while the center was barely warm with undermelted cheese. Clear sign of an oven that's not properly calibrated or monitored."
Perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio,2024-02-26,5,"They've perfected the ratio of sauce to cheese - enough sauce to be flavorful and moist but not so much that it makes the crust soggy. The cheese covers evenly but isn't overwhelming. Technical perfection!"
Weird aftertaste,2024-03-01,2,"Everything seemed fine at first bite, but there was a strange metallic aftertaste that became more pronounced as I continued eating. Not sure if it was the sauce or something in their water for the dough."
Outstanding variety of options,2024-01-07,5,"Their menu has something for everyone - traditional options done well, creative specialties, and customizable choices. Even have dessert pizzas that are surprisingly good (try the Nutella and banana!)."
All style no substance,2024-02-21,3,"The restaurant looks trendy and their branding is cool, but the pizza itself is just average. Seems like they invested more in Instagram-worthy décor than in developing a distinctive, delicious product."
Perfect temperature every time,2024-03-15,5,"However they do it, their pizza always arrives at the perfect temperature - hot enough that the cheese is still stretchy but not so hot that it burns your mouth. Consistently excellent, even on busy nights."
Stale-tasting crust,2024-01-29,2,"The crust had a stale, almost cardboard-like quality that suggests either old dough or old flour. Fresh ingredients on top couldn't compensate for the foundation being off."
Excellent wine pairings,2024-02-07,5,"Their curated wine list is designed specifically to pair with their pizzas, and the staff is knowledgeable about suggesting the perfect match. The house red with their sausage pizza is a transcendent combination."
Too much garlic,2024-03-08,3,"I love garlic but this was excessive - felt like they mistook cloves for teaspoons in the recipe. My breath was lethal afterward, and the powerful flavor overwhelmed the other ingredients."
Perfect for kids' parties,2024-01-11,5,"Hosted my son's birthday here and it was fantastic. They did a dough-tossing demonstration for the kids, let them make their own mini pizzas, and the staff was incredibly patient and kind."
Toppings slide right off,2024-02-11,2,"The ratio of sauce to cheese was so off that all the toppings slid off with the first bite. Ended up eating what was essentially dough with sauce while the cheese and toppings formed a pile on my plate."
Expert-level pizza folding,2024-03-10,5,"Their thin-crust slices fold perfectly New York-style without cracking or losing toppings. The slight resistance before the fold is exactly what you want - showing the perfect balance of crisp and chew."
No flavor distinction,2024-01-17,3,"Ordered two completely different specialty pizzas but they somehow tasted nearly identical. It's like they use the same base for everything and the toppings don't impart enough distinctive character."
Righteous ranch drizzle,2024-02-03,5,"Their house-made ranch drizzle takes their pizzas to another level. It's not your typical ranch - has hints of dill and garlic with a perfect consistency that adds creaminess without making things soggy."
Too much cheese,2024-03-04,2,"There is such a thing as too much cheese, and this place proves it. The excessive cheese made the pizza so heavy and greasy that it was unpleasant to eat. Quality should matter more than quantity."
Perfect crunch factor,2024-01-24,5,"The bottom of their crust has the perfect level of crunch - you hear it when you bite in, but it's not so hard that it hurts your mouth. Technical pizza perfection that's clearly the result of careful testing."
Burned mouth on first bite,2024-02-20,2,"They served the pizza dangerously hot - barely out of the oven with no time to cool. Severely burned the roof of my mouth on the first bite, which ruined the rest of the meal and my next few days."
Superior ingredients make the difference,2024-03-18,5,"They import their flour from Italy, use San Marzano tomatoes, and make their mozzarella in-house daily. The commitment to quality ingredients is evident in every bite - nothing is an afterthought."
Underwhelming and basic,2024-01-09,3,"Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing memorable either. Standard crust, standard sauce, standard toppings. In a city with so many pizza options, this place doesn't give you any reason to return."
Excellent attention to cooking time,2024-02-22,5,"They nail the cooking time perfectly - pulling the pizza from the oven at exactly the right moment when the cheese is fully melted and bubbling but not yet browned. Shows expertise and attention to detail."
False advertising on size,2024-03-12,2,"Their menu clearly states that a large pizza is 16 inches, but what we received couldn't have been more than 14 inches. When questioned, they claimed their menu was outdated but refused any adjustment."
Perfect ingredient distribution,2024-01-06,5,"Every bite had the perfect combination of ingredients - no barren spots, no overwhelming clumps. The toppings were distributed with such precision it almost seemed measured. The mark of true professionals!"
Lackluster veggie options,2024-02-19,3,"Their vegetable toppings lacked freshness and flavor - the mushrooms were clearly canned, the peppers were soft and faded, and the onions were sparse. Disappointing for a place that advertises farm-fresh ingredients."
Ideal char-to-chew ratio,2024-03-03,5,"The small charred bubbles on the crust add amazing flavor without dominating. They've mastered that balance between the slight bitterness of char and the natural sweetness of the dough. Technical perfection!"
Cheese solidified too quickly,2024-01-31,2,"The cheese hardened into a solid mass before we were even halfway through the pizza. By the end, it was like eating a cheese cracker on bread. Suggests poor quality cheese or improper handling."
Brilliant buffalo chicken pizza,2024-02-15,5,"Their buffalo chicken pizza balances spicy and creamy perfectly - the chicken is actually high-quality and juicy (not the dry cubes many places use), and the blue cheese is distributed perfectly for balanced bites."
No-cheese option was all sauce,2024-03-11,2,"Ordered a cheese-free pizza for my dairy-allergic friend, but they made no adjustments - just removed the cheese and left a soggy sauce-covered bread. Good pizza without cheese requires rebalancing other elements."
Outstanding breakfast pizza,2024-01-14,5,"Their brunch pizza with bacon, eggs, and hollandaise sauce is incredible. The eggs are perfectly cooked with runny yolks that create a rich sauce when broken. Worth waking up early for weekend brunch!"
Painfully obvious cheap ingredients,2024-02-08,2,"The pre-shredded cheese didn't melt properly, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the sausage had that distinctive processed flavor. At these prices, cutting corners on ingredients is inexcusable."
Perfect for late-night cravings,2024-03-07,5,"Open until 3am on weekends, this place has saved many late nights. The slices are huge, they reheat them perfectly so they're crispy, and their special late-night menu items are creative and delicious."
Too thin to be satisfying,2024-01-25,3,"Their ultra-thin crust might appeal to some, but it was too insubstantial to be satisfying. Felt like I was eating toppings on a cracker rather than a proper pizza. Left still feeling hungry."
Masterful use of olive oil,2024-02-28,5,"The drizzle of high-quality olive oil they add just before serving makes all the difference - adds richness, enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, and adds a wonderful aromatic element. Simple but transformative."
Absurdly small slices,2024-03-05,2,"Their 8-slice large pizza had slices so small they were almost comical - two bites and they're gone. For the price charged, the portion size is simply unacceptable. Felt like a ripoff."
Perfect balance of herbs in the sauce,2024-01-02,5,"Their sauce has a complex herb profile that evolves as you eat - initial notes of basil give way to oregano, with subtle garlic and a hint of fennel in the finish. Clearly made by someone who understands flavor development."
Tough leathery crust,2024-02-04,2,"The crust was so tough I almost couldn't bite through it - like trying to eat leather. The edges were particularly problematic, had to tear pieces off with significant effort. Completely lacks the pleasant chewiness good pizza should have."
Exceptional spinach ricotta pie,2024-03-09,5,"Their white pizza with spinach and ricotta is exceptional - the creamy richness of the cheese balanced by the slight bitterness of the greens. The garlic-infused olive oil base ties everything together perfectly."
Sloppy presentation,2024-01-13,3,"The pizza looked like it had been assembled in a hurry - toppings haphazardly thrown on, cheese unevenly distributed, and the cutting was so uneven that some slices were twice the size of others. Taste was okay, but appearance matters too."
Brilliant seasonal rotation,2024-02-23,5,"Love that they have a rotating seasonal pizza that showcases what's fresh. The current spring offering with asparagus, green garlic, and fresh peas is bright and delicious - a perfect reflection of the season."
Way too much crust,2024-03-16,2,"The edge crust (cornicione) was comically large - almost half of each slice was just bread with no toppings. This ratio of crust to actual pizza was way off and made for a disappointing experience."
Perfect textural contrast,2024-01-18,5,"The contrast between the crisp bottom, the tender interior crumb, the gooey cheese, and the slight resistance of the toppings creates a textural symphony. Each bite is interesting and satisfying in a different way."
Unmelted cheese in the center,2024-02-06,2,"The edges were fine but the center had cold, unmelted cheese - a sign the oven wasn't hot enough or the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. Basic pizza fundamentals seem to be lacking."
Innovative flavor combinations,2024-03-13,5,"Their 'Avant Garde' menu section features combinations I would never have thought of but somehow work perfectly. The pear, gorgonzola, walnut, and honey pizza was a revelation of sweet, salty, and savory harmony."
Burned bottom raw top,2024-01-20,1,"The bottom of the crust was completely black while the cheese on top wasn't fully melted. This temperature imbalance suggests serious issues with their oven management and pizza-making technique."
Perfect for watching sports,2024-02-27,4,"Great setup with TVs visible from every table, excellent pitcher specials during games, and their 'Game Day' pizza loaded with multiple meats and jalapeños is the perfect sports-watching food. Atmosphere gets lively but not obnoxious."
Sauce had an odd chemical taste,2024-03-02,2,"The sauce had a strange artificial flavor - almost like they used sauce mix rather than real tomatoes. Had an unpleasant chemical aftertaste that lingered long after eating. Very disappointing."
Outstanding wood-fired perfection,2024-01-04,5,"The wood-fired oven gives their pizza a distinctive smoky complexity you can't get any other way. The slight char adds bitterness that balances the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Worth seeking out for this unique flavor profile."
Too much salt in the dough,2024-02-10,2,"The crust was so salty it was almost inedible - overwhelmed all the other flavors and left me incredibly thirsty afterward. A heavy hand with salt ruined what could have been a good pizza."
Excellence in simplicity,2024-03-19,5,"Their classic Margherita showcases their commitment to quality - the balance of sweet-acidic tomato sauce, creamy fresh mozzarella, fragrant basil, and that perfectly chewy-crisp crust. Proof that simple can be sublime."
Suspiciously uniform toppings,2024-01-30,3,"All the vegetable toppings were cut in precisely identical shapes and sizes, suggesting they came pre-cut from a food service provider rather than being prepared fresh in-house as claimed. Tasted fine but felt deceived by the marketing."
Perfect niche for Roman-style pizza,2024-02-25,5,"Their Roman-style pizza al taglio (rectangular, with a focaccia-like base) is a welcome alternative to the usual round pies. The airy, light crust holds up wonderfully to the creative topping combinations. A distinctive option in a crowded pizza market."
Pizza barely survived the drive home,2024-03-04,2,"Ordered takeout and by the time I got home (15 minutes), the pizza was a soggy mess. They clearly don't use appropriate packaging for takeout - no vents to release steam means the crust steams itself into sogginess."
Magnificent flavor layering,2024-01-15,5,"The thoughtful layering of ingredients creates a perfect progression of flavors - the spicy soppressata reveals the sweetness of the roasted red peppers, which contrasts with the brininess of the olives. Every bite is a journey."
Crust like cardboard,2024-02-12,2,"The crust had all the flavor and texture of packing material - dry, tough, and completely devoid of character. Even the decent toppings couldn't save it. The foundation of good pizza is good dough, and this wasn't it."
Perfect for large parties,2024-03-14,5,"Their party package is fantastic - multiple 18-inch pizzas with varied toppings, plenty of sides, and they were accommodating with our group of 20. Everything arrived hot and on time, and they included all the necessary paper goods."
False advertising on ingredients,2024-01-08,1,"Menu promised 'house-made Italian sausage' but what came on my pizza was clearly pre-formed, uniform pellets of commercial sausage. When questioned, staff admitted they don't make any ingredients in-house despite menu claims."
Supreme quality control,2024-02-18,5,"Visited multiple times and the consistency is impressive - every pizza comes out identical to the last one, with the same excellent quality. Shows serious commitment to training and standards that's rare in casual dining."
Pizza arrived upside-down,2024-03-06,1,"Delivery driver must have taken a sharp turn because our pizza arrived completely flipped over in the box - all toppings stuck to the lid. Restaurant offered no solution other than suggesting we 'scrape it off and reassemble it.'"
Exceptional sauce-making technique,2024-01-26,5,"You can tell their sauce is made with properly hand-crushed tomatoes - it has that perfect texture with small chunks rather than being completely smooth. The bright flavor suggests minimal cooking, allowing the tomato quality to shine."
Too much emphasis on appearance,2024-02-14,3,"The pizza was clearly designed to look good in photos - perfect symmetry, vibrant colors, photogenic cheese pull - but the flavor was underwhelming. Style over substance for the Instagram crowd."
Brilliant use of fermented dough,2024-03-17,5,"Their 72-hour fermented dough has incredible depth of flavor with subtle sourdough notes. The extended fermentation creates a complex web of flavors and perfect texture that you simply can't achieve with quick-rise methods."
Excessive grease pooling,2024-01-22,2,"Had to continuously blot the pizza with napkins as pools of orange grease formed on top of the cheese with every passing minute. By the end, the napkins were completely saturated and transparent. Felt unhealthy even by pizza standards."
Perfect for dietary restrictions,2024-02-09,5,"As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciate that they take dietary concerns seriously. Their allergen matrix is comprehensive, staff is knowledgeable, and they have proper protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Finally can enjoy pizza safely!"
Tasteless cheese substitute,2024-03-01,2,"Their vegan cheese option was terrible - had no meltability, a grainy texture, and tasted strongly of coconut which clashed with the tomato sauce. If you can't do vegan cheese well, better to offer cheese-free options that are properly balanced."
Masterclass in proper baking,2024-01-10,5,"Watching the pizzaiolo work the oven is like watching an artist - constantly rotating pizzas, adjusting their position based on hot spots, and pulling each one at precisely the right moment. This attention to the baking process makes all the difference."
Tomato sauce tasted rancid,2024-02-16,1,"The sauce had a distinctly off flavor that suggested the tomatoes had gone bad before processing. After two bites, couldn't continue eating as the rancid notes became more pronounced. Basic food safety seems questionable."
Perfect buffalo mozzarella application,2024-03-20,5,"They understand that buffalo mozzarella shouldn't be cooked too long or it loses its distinctive texture and flavor. Applied in dollops after the pizza is mostly baked so it just barely melts while maintaining its creamy integrity. Technical perfection!"
