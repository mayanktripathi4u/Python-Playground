# Dunder Methods in Python
Dunder methods (short for "double underscore" methods) in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores (__). 

They play a crucial role in defining how objects of custom classes interact with built-in functions and operations. 

These methods are part of Python's data model and enable you to customize behavior for your objects.
