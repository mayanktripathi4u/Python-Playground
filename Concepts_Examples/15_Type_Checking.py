# Type Checking with mypy
# To check type annotations, you can use a static type checker like mypy. Install it via pip:
# pip install mypy

# Then run it on your code:
# mypy your_script.py

# `mypy` will report any type mismatches based on the annotations provided.

'''
# Summary
* Type Annotations: Allow you to specify expected types for variables, function parameters, and return values.
* Benefits: Improve readability, enable static type checking, and enhance IDE support.
* Usage: Annotate variables, functions, complex data structures, and class attributes.

By using type annotations, you can write more robust and maintainable code with better tooling support.
