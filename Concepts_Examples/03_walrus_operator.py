"""
Walrus Operator " := "

It is a feature introduced in Python 3.8. 
It allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression. 
This operator is formally known as the "assignment expression" operator. 
It can be used to simplify code by combining variable assignment and expression evaluation into a single step.

"""

# Basic Usage: The walrus operator := assigns a value to a variable as part of an expression. Hereâ€™s a basic example:
# Traditional approach
value = input("Enter a value: ")
if value:
    print(f"You entered: {value}")

# Using walrus operator
if (value := input("Enter a value: ")):
    print(f"You entered: {value}")

'''
In this example, the walrus operator assigns the result of input() to value and then evaluates value in the if statement. This approach avoids having to call input() twice and makes the code more concise.

# Limitations and Considerations
* Readability: While the walrus operator can make code more concise, overusing it or using it in complex expressions might reduce readability. Ensure that the code remains clear and understandable.
* Scope: The walrus operator can only be used in expressions, not in statements or places where an assignment is not allowed.

The walrus operator is a powerful tool for Python developers, making certain patterns more concise and reducing redundancy in code. However, it should be used judiciously to maintain code readability and clarity.
